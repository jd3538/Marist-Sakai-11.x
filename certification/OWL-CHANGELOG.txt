2013.03.11:
	-[OWL-406] Added an option to hide requirements from site members
2013.03.04:

2013.02.28:
	-[OWL-440] When you don't have a Will Expire Criterion (wechi), you no longer get expiration date as an option when setting the field values on page 3 unless a field value has already been set to expiration date
2013.02.26:
	-[OWL-495] [OWL-403] [OWL-402] - Implemented a display options panel to filter the reporting interface
2013.02.06:
	-[OWL-306] Fixed the cancel button functionality - clicking 'next' no longer saves anything to the database. Only the "Activate Certificate" button makes changes
2013.01.16:
	-[OWL-446] Added better handling when the certificate name or description is too long. UI messages are more appropriate
2013.01.04:

	-Massive refactoring
2012.12.10:

2012.11.29:

	-On the create certificate page 2, the instructions change when there's no criteria vs when there is criteria
	-On the same page, the divs that indicate the selected criteria are replaced with li's within a ul
	-Fixed a consistency issue between the student view and the report regarding unreleased gradebook items. Final grade criteria may have an issue with unreleased gradebook items still
2012.11.28:
	-Modified the reporting interface to report on the union of historic users (users who have been graded) and current members who have the certificate.be.awarded permission
	-Displays the user's role in the site or 'Not a member' if they're no longer a member
	-Fixed the UI when there are no certificates in the site (for both student and instructor views)
	-Change the mime type to "application/force-download". Hopefully this will fix the issues where it loads in the iframe
2012.11.27:
	-Added and implemented the certificate.be.awarded permission
	-Added a check to prevent users without that permission from downloading the certificate via the url
	-Added a page to appear when a user without that permission visits the tool
	-Reporting interface now reports only on users who have earned grades in the site and who have certificate.be.awarded (which is a problem because deleted users don't have a role for which that permission should be checked against)
2012.11.26:
	-Fixed the issue from November 21st. We are now independent of the certificate_award table.
	-Removed the gradebook item from the Will Expire Criterion
	-Added a check to prevent users from downloading certificates that they haven't earned (ie. via urls such as http://localhost:8081/portal/tool/565af98f-73cc-4f0f-a0d9-f24cad5200b7/print.form?certId=ff8081813b19b6ee013b19bbf2990003)
2012.11.22:
	-Resolved an exception that was thrown when retrieving scores from unreleased gradebook items
	-Completed i18n
	-Still need to remove the gradebook item from the expiration criterion
2012.11.21:
	-Added the certificate's criteria to the report view to help instructors see why each student was awarded or not
	-Replaced the 'check status' functionality - it now shows a link directly to your certificate iff you met the criteria. (This opened up a bug preventing certificates to be awarded to new users. This was resolved on the 26th)
2012.11.20:
	-Treating employeeNumbers more like the gradebook - user properties are specified in sakai.properties, and there are site role permissions to determine whether a person can see this information in their report
2012.11.16:
	-Added the reporting interface for instructors
	-Removed some privilege escalations
	- [OWL-303] can't have more than one expiry
	- [OWL-303] expiry can't be the only criterion
2012.09.14:
	-[OWL-307][OWL-332] Added introductory blurbs
	-[OWL-334] Removed the preview stuff as there didn't seem to be any implementation for any file type. Formatted the date of the award
	-[OWL-301] Renamed table headings
2012.09.13:
	-createCertificatePageTwo said "gradebook is empty" in all cases when a multiple choice variable couldn't be populated. Changed this to get appropriate messages
2012.09.12:
	-[OWL-308] If an expiration date is a criterion, the date of issue is the date of grade entry. Otherwise it looks for a gradebook criterion to find a date of entry. If none are found, it uses the date of award (default behaviour)
	-Added handling in case a gradebook item gets deleted, then a student tries to retrieve their pdf (prints an warn to the log and draws an empty string on the pdf)
2012.09.11:
	-Expiry date is now based on the gradebook's date of entry and it shows on the pdfs
2012.09.10:
	-When editing a certificate definition, the template fields now default to appropriate values
2012.09.06:
	-[OWL-299] Now makes the session switch to admin temporarily to store the pdf in global resources. Works for instructors to create the templates and works for students to view their certificates
	-[OWL-322] Switched checkboxes to radiobuttons
2012.08.31:
	-[OWL-311] Removed the expiry offset from the first page
2012.08.30:
	-[OWL-311] Created the criterion for expiration dates some specified # of months after the last time the user was graded on a specified gradebook item
2012.08.28:
	-[OWL-311] Swapped pages 2 and 3
	-[OWL-303] Changed the logic, made some messages prettier (but this will need revision)
2012.08.27:
	-[OWL-297] Replaced the unique constraint on CertificateDefinition names with a unique constraint on both CertificateDefinition names & siteIds
	-[OWL-310] Replaced the lowercase "k" with uppercase in the delete confirmation for the "OK" button
	-[OWL-305] Removed all instances of the save progress button and the corresponding source code.
	-[OWL-304] Removed the next button on the fourth page
	-[OWL-309] Replaced 'Print' with 'View' in 3 places -> once as mentioned in the ticket, once in the page title, and once in a link to the page
2012.08.23:
	-Replaced all methods using Spring's @Resource and @Autowired annotation with methods containing ComponentManager calls. Tomcat shuts down properly now. #SpringIsAWasteOfTime
2012.08.20:
	-Applied a patch from RSmart that resolves a few issues in hibernate
2012.03.29:
	- [OWL-152] added ability to specify expiry offset in certificate definition
2012.03.19:
	-Modified pom.xml - rsmart's common-tool-lib is now in a provided scope so that we don't have to manually add the jar to our .m2/repository folders
	-CertificateDefinition.setDescription() called .trim() which could cause a null pointer exception, so we check this now
2012.03.13:
	-The tool was only available to course sites. Just enabled the tool for project sites
	-Modified the user interface - removed any talk about ${} stuff
2012.03.12:
	-When editing the tool, the administrator couldn't switch the pdf file. They'd click 'browse' and select a pdf file, but it wouldn't actually change. I fixed this.
2012.03.08:
	-When configuring the tool, RSMART expected users to type in stuff that looks like "${}" into text fields. This will not do. So I replaced the text fields with dropdowns containing the description of the variables that are available, this completely hides the "${}" uglyness from the user
2012.03.06:
	-To date: 
		-checked out the tool from https://source.sakaiproject.org/contrib/rsmart/certification/
		-got it to build and fixed a few exceptions 
			-modified poms: 
				-changed the parent to point to base/org.sakaiproject rather than rsn-base/com.rsmart
				-added missing dependencies:
					-model/pom.xml - scheduler-events-model
					-tool/pom.xml - sakai-metaobj-tool-lib
		-updated CertificateDefinitionStatusEnumUserType.java: 
			-an import statement was pointing to a class that had changed packages
